# Data Systems Project - Uncovering Modus Operandi

Hello web user! Good to see you here on our Data Systems Project web application. This tool is comprised 
of two components, namely two dashboards embedded from Tableau and our webscraper. You need our credentials to see the dashboards, so we will provide this during the Symposium. The webscraper we built is simply put a system that allows the user the query dutch court cases with the keyword 'drugs'. This data will then be processed and appended to the correct tables in our hosted database. What is nice as well, is the fact that these Tableau dashboards have a live connection with this database, so that whenever the scraper pushed the latest data, these cases will be taken into account in its visualizations. A high-level overview of this architecture is shown in the figure on the right. 

Happy scraping!
